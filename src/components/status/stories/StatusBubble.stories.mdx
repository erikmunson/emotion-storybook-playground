# StatusBubble

<Subtitle>
  Status bubbles are useful for quickly conveying the overall status of a specific dimension or attribute. Given their
  compact and information-dense design, they are especially appropriate in areas with limited screen real estate or
  where adding too much explanatory detail for each variety of status could harm overall usability.
</Subtitle>

### Sizes

There are 5 bubble sizes to choose from: `xs`, `s`, `m`, `l`, and `xl`.
