# StatusCard

<Subtitle>
  Status cards are useful for explaining the status of a specific dimension or attribute in moderate detail. They are
  well suited for areas where there might be multiple dimensions of status to communicate at the same time, as their
  recognizable color and visual consistency makes it easier to scan down a list of cards.

### Appearances

There are 7 statuses to pick from: `inactive`, `neutral`, `info`, `progress`, `success`, `warning`, and `error`.

### Descriptions

Status cards can optionally include a `description`, which allows for structured explanations. For example, you might
use the title to briefly summarize what happened, and the description to add secondary details like who did it and
additional explanatory metadata. Descriptions — like titles — can be either a simple text string or a React element/fragment.
