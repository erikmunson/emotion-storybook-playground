# Icon

<Subtitle>
  Icons are used throughout Spinnaker to help convey meaning, set context, and make it easier to visually parse
  informaion-dense screens. The Icon component API is intentionally restricted to a few curated visual appearances and
  sizes to help you build UIs with more confidence and encourage a consistent experience.
</Subtitle>

### Sizes

There are 5 icon sizes to choose from: `extraSmall`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, and `extraLarge`:

<Preview>
  <Story id="icon--sizes" />
</Preview>

### Appearances

Icons themselves never have color applied â€” they are always grayscale. The three visual apperances you can choose from are `light`, `neutral`, and `dark`:

<Preview>
  <Story id="icon--appearances" />
</Preview>

### Props

<Props of={Icon} exclude={['legacyColor', 'legacySize']} />
